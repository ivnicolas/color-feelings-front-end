# Color Your Feeling Project(Front-end)

This application seeks to explore the ways people associate different feelings to different colors. Through this app a user will make a selection of a feeling and a color to match. These color cards are displayed on the main page and users can filter through other color cards by associated feelings to see the associations made by others. 

## Motivation 
I simply love colors. I use them a lot in my art and my personal style can be described as being very colorful. For me, every color allign with a certain mood. I wanted to observe the way other people think about colors and also build a cute and kitchy website to match.
